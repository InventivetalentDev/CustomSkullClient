**This client & API are outdated. Please use [mineskin.org](https://mineskin.org) / [MineskinClient](https://github.com/InventivetalentDev/MineskinClient)**

Client for [skulls.inventivetalent.org](https://skulls.inventivetalent.org)

Can be used to generate valid texture data from skin image files.  
You can also use [this online tool](https://tools.inventivetalent.org/custom-skulls/) to directly generate skull data from images.

The API requires official Minecraft accounts to upload the skin textures.  
If you own a Minecraft account you don't actively use and want to contibute to the API's speed, please [contact me](https://inventivetalent.org/contact)!
